Dear Teralytic,

I would love to work for you in an Analytics and Machine Learning role.

Teralytic's product is focused on increasing farm productivity by increasing efficiency and sustainability. This is the kind of product I'm always trying to be involved with - one that creates a positive social impact sustained by strong financial performance.

With the breadth and granularity of data streaming through your sensors, I'm confident there are numerous opportunities to develop new features and enhance existing functionality with data science and artificial intelligence.

On paper, I may not have the advanced degree or years of experience typically associated with data science work. Instead, I am an individual whose work begins as collaborative and growth-focused, and who aggressively scales in skillset and domain knowledge as an individual contributor.

My work history reflects this promise. At Avanade this year, I went from a fledgling understanding of OOP in C# to designing and coding significant portions of our ETL pipes as well as owning neural network architecture for our cloud optimization tools and demos. Prior to that, I developed an advanced understanding of SQL through contract projects with Boeing and Apex Learning. Outside of programming experiences, I also had a similarly steep learning curve building national community retention programs for Riot Games and Blizzard Entertainment, the two largest companies in the esports industry.

For your further reference, I've attached my full resume.

I would love to join your team in bringing automation and intelligence to agriculture! I look forward to speaking with you!

Sincerely,
Rahul Devanarayanan
